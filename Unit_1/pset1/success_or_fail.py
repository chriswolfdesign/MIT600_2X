success(function_call, expected_result, received_result)

This function takes in the function_call you are attempting to debug.  The
program will then announce that the function_call was performed correctly.
If user provides expected_result and received_result, the program will also
print those for the user to see and add to their data.

function_call: string - A string representation of the function you just

                          your program to provide.

received_result: string - A string representation of the output your program
